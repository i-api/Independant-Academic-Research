# Work Description
In the area below, please describe the work that you will be doing (Max. 500 Characters).

My research will focus on the mathematical basis for Financial Derivatives, such as options contracts and other derivative instruments, and how assets are classified, calculated and priced in the market using data models. The Black-Scholes model, and Monte Carlo methods will be used to explore these data models, in addition to the Greek Financial ratios. My research will conclude with a literature review, a report on my findings, and a computer data model that will consolidate my research.


In more detail:

I will be doing independant academic research on the mathematical basis for Financial Derivatives. My research will focus on options contracts and derivative instruments, and how these baskets of assets are classified, calculated and priced in the market using data models. The Black-Scholes model will be used to expore these data models, and the Greeks Financial ratios (delta δ, gamma γ, rho ρ, theta θ) (alpha α and betaβ will NOT be included) will be used to calculate the sensitivity of the price of the option to changes in the underlying asset on a mathematical basis. I will also be using the Monte Carlo method to price options contracts. My research will consist of a literature review, and a report on my findings, as well as a computer data model that will consolidate my research.
