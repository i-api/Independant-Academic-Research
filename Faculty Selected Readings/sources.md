## J. C. Hull (1997) , Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives 
    - Binomial Trees (we won't examine binomial trees; used before BS was invented)
    - Wiener processes and Ito's lemma
    - The Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model

## Kong et al. (2020), Python Programming and Numerical Methods: A Guide for Engineers and Scientists
    - https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter00.00-Preface.html
    - we will explore finite difference methods (FDMs) https://pythonnumericalmethods.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter23.00-ODE-Boundary-Value-Problems.html
    - Although the techniques shown in this book consider ordinary differential equations (ODEs), they also apply to PDEs.
