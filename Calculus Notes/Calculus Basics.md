# Calculus Basics



## How to tell if a limit exists: 
There are several methods to determine if a limit of a function exists at a certain point. Some of the most common methods include:

1. Graphical Method: By plotting the function on a graph, you can visually inspect if the function approaches a particular value as the independent variable approaches the point in question.

2. Algebraic Method: By simplifying the function and substituting the given point into the expression, you can determine if the limit exists. If the expression evaluates to a finite number, the limit exists.

3. Factorization and Cancellation Method: By factoring out common factors from the numerator and denominator of the function, you can cancel out some terms and see if the limit exists.

4. L'Hopital's Rule: If the function has the form of 0/0 or infinity/infinity, L'Hopital's rule can be used. It states that if we take the derivative of the numerator and denominator and the limit of the ratio of these derivatives exist, than the original limit exist.

5. Squeeze Theorem: if you can find two functions f(x) and g(x) that bound a given function h(x) such that f(x)≤h(x)≤g(x) and both f(x) and g(x) have a limit at a point a, then h(x) must also have a limit at that point.

It is important to note that the limit of a function may exist at a certain point, but the function may not be defined at that point.


## How to tell if a derivative exists:
There are several methods to determine if a derivative of a function exists at a certain point. Some of the most common methods include:

1. Graphical Method: By plotting the function on a graph, you can visually inspect if the function has a clear slope at the point in question. However, this method can be unreliable, as the slope might look like it exists, but might not be well defined.

2. Algebraic Method: By taking the derivative of the function and substituting the given point into the expression, you can determine if the derivative exists. If the expression evaluates to a finite number, the derivative exists at that point.

3. Limit Definition of the Derivative: The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x=a, is defined as the limit as h approaches to zero of (f(a+h)-f(a))/h, if this limit exists, then the derivative exists.

4. Differentiability: A function is said to be differentiable at a point if the limit as h approaches to zero of (f(a+h)-f(a))/h exists. If a function is differentiable at a point, then the derivative exists.

5. Analyzing the function's domain and any singularities: A point where the function is not defined or has a discontinuity, the derivative will not exist.

It is important to note that a function may be differentiable everywhere but not continuous. A function that is continuous everywhere is said to be smooth, this function will have a derivative everywhere.
